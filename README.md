## Business Insights
1) We conducted the ttest to conclude that the **mean purchase value** of **females is less than that of males**.
Also with **95% confidence**, we can say that the population mean purchase values of **males** is **[8734-8737]** dollars and that of **females** is **[9435-9439]** dollars.

2) Generally males prefer electronics, video games or fitness tools which are priced higher than the product preferred by females which are clothing, beauty and personal care, home product except for jewellery.

3) Mean Expenses by Males and Females
Population mean **expense of Females** is between **8883 - 9047** dollars.
Population mean **expense of Males** is between **9749 - 9864** dollars.

4) Mean purchase value **per transaction** by **Males** is **9473.5** dollars and **Females** is **8734.5** dollars.

7) Mean purchase value **increases** as **age group increases** i.e. the purchase power of the customer increases as he ages more and has more **savings** on black friday sale.

## Recommedations
1) Consider **pricing strategies** for both genders males and females. We could have relatively low prices on the primary products brought by females and a bit higher or premium segment products to be bought by males.

2) Adjust the **stock level** based on the spending patterns of both males and females.

3) For married and unmarried that is couples or singles their mean purchase value is **similar**. Hence it is required to keep the **product diversified** between personal and family need.

4) In Age groups, we could try to have **more** products in store related to **older** customer then younger customers.

5) **Advertise** more offers for **younger** Customers to increase their purchase value but it is gonna be difficult as they won't be having much savings as those to the older once.

## Future Work
1) Study the relation between Gender and different product categories to get purchase value by different genders on specific products.

2) Study the relation gender given marital status, maybe married womens are spending more than married mens or vice versa.

3) Try other variables like City, to have the walmart in particular city stocked up with particular product categories w.r.t the mean purchase value of customers.
